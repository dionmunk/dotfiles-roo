description: "Create a project memory bank (memory-bank/) with imports + index, and enforce project memory rules."
---

You are running in a VS Code workspace.

Goal:
Create a persistent project memory bank under `memory-bank/` (kebab-case filenames), including an imports area for reference material, plus a project-specific rules file under `.roo/rules/` to enforce consultation of project memory before acting.

Rules:
- Do NOT overwrite existing files.
- Do NOT delete or rename any existing files.
- If a directory or file already exists, leave it unchanged.
- If a required file is missing, create it using the templates below.
- After completion, print a short summary listing what was created vs what already existed.

Steps:
1) Ensure the `memory-bank/` directory exists at the workspace root.
2) Ensure the `memory-bank/imports/` directory exists at the workspace root.
3) Ensure the following `memory-bank/imports/` subdirectories exist:
   - `memory-bank/imports/api/`
   - `memory-bank/imports/schemas/`
   - `memory-bank/imports/diagrams/`
   - `memory-bank/imports/references/`
4) Ensure the `.roo/rules/` directory exists at the workspace root.
5) Ensure the following `memory-bank/` files exist:
   - `memory-bank/README.md`
   - `memory-bank/index.md`
   - `memory-bank/project-brief.md`
   - `memory-bank/product-context.md`
   - `memory-bank/active-context.md`
   - `memory-bank/system-patterns.md`
   - `memory-bank/tech-context.md`
   - `memory-bank/progress.md`
   - `memory-bank/conventions.md`
   - `memory-bank/decisions.md`
   - `memory-bank/glossary.md`
6) Ensure the following imports README exists:
   - `memory-bank/imports/README.md`
7) Ensure the following rules file exists:
   - `.roo/rules/rules.md`

Templates (use these exactly for newly created files):

# Project Memory (`memory-bank/`)

This directory contains **persistent project context** shared by humans and automated tools.
It is the **source of truth** for understanding *why* this project exists, *how* it is built,
and *what* is currently happening.

If you are new to this repository, **start here**.

---

## Why This Exists

Projects accumulate context faster than code:
- architectural decisions
- constraints and tradeoffs
- ongoing work
- “gotchas” that aren’t obvious from reading files

The `memory-bank/` directory captures that context in a **structured, version-controlled way** so it:
- doesn’t live only in people’s heads
- doesn’t get lost across sessions
- stays close to the code

---

## How to Use This Folder

### If you are a developer:
- Read these files before making significant changes
- Update them when your work changes project direction or status
- Treat them like living documentation, not static specs

### If you are reviewing a PR:
- Check whether relevant `memory-bank/` files were updated
- Especially:
  - `active-context.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `decisions.md`

### If you are onboarding:
1. Read `project-brief.md`
2. Read `system-patterns.md`
3. Skim `tech-context.md`
4. Check `active-context.md` to see what’s happening now

| `imports/`           | Reference material (API specs, schemas, diagrams, vendor docs) |

---

## Imported References

Additional reference material belongs in:

- `memory-bank/imports/`

See `memory-bank/imports/README.md` for organization and an import log.

---

## Writing Guidelines

- Prefer clear bullets over long prose
- Be factual; avoid speculation
- Label uncertainty clearly
- Keep entries short and scannable
- Dates are helpful for context

This is **working memory**, not a spec.

---

## Contribution Expectations

If your change:
- affects architecture
- introduces new constraints
- changes current focus
- creates long-term implications

…then it probably requires updating at least one file in `memory-bank/`.

Treat missing updates as a documentation bug.

## Core Memory
- `memory-bank/project-brief.md`
- `memory-bank/product-context.md`
- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/system-patterns.md`
- `memory-bank/tech-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`

# Imported References (`memory-bank/imports/`)

This folder contains **supporting reference material** that helps developers and automated tools understand
the project, but is not part of the core memory files.

Examples:
- API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman collections)
- Database schemas or ERDs
- Architecture diagrams
- External vendor docs or integration notes
- Request/response examples
- “Golden” JSON payloads used for tests

## Where to Put Things

- `api/` — OpenAPI specs, Postman collections, API examples
- `schemas/` — DB schemas, ERDs, migrations notes
- `diagrams/` — PNG/SVG/PDF diagrams, sequence charts
- `references/` — vendor docs, RFC notes, external references

## Guidelines

- Keep imported files as small as practical
- Avoid secrets (no API keys, tokens, passwords)
- Prefer versioned/dated files when helpful
- Add a log entry below when you add or update a reference

## Import Log

- (YYYY-MM-DD) <short name> — <what it is> — <source/location> — <notes>

## Notes for Automated Tools

- Treat files in `memory-bank/imports/` as reference-only unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Prefer core memory files for “source of truth” decisions, and use imports to validate details (e.g., API shapes).

## Project Memory Requirement (Strict)

Before answering, planning, or modifying code, you **must** consult all relevant files under the `memory-bank/` directory.

If required information is missing, outdated, or contradictory, **stop and ask for clarification** before proceeding.

If your proposed action conflicts with guidance in `memory-bank/`, **explicitly call out the conflict and do not proceed** until it is resolved.

If `memory-bank/` files cannot be accessed or do not exist, **pause and request confirmation** before continuing.
