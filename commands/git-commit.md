description: "Suggest Conventional Commit message(s) from current changes and provide a copy-ready snippet."
---

You are running in a VS Code workspace.

Goal:
Analyze the current git changes and suggest high-quality Conventional Commit message(s).
Prefer staged changes when present. Do NOT create commits—only suggest messages.

STRICT SAFETY RULE:
- You MUST NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, or modify git history in any way.
- You MUST ONLY analyze repository state and OUTPUT suggested commit message(s).

Hard Requirements:
- All suggestions MUST follow Conventional Commits:
  <type>(optional-scope): <subject>
- Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Subject rules:
  - imperative mood
  - no trailing period
  - <= 72 characters
- Scope: optional but recommended when obvious
- If a breaking change is detected, use `!` and include a BREAKING CHANGE note.
- Do not invent changes that are not present in git status/diff/log.

Process:
1) Collect git context (read-only commands only):
   - git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   - git status --porcelain=v1
   - git diff --stat
   - git diff
   - git diff --staged --stat
   - git diff --staged
   - git log -n 10 --oneline --decorate

2) Determine review target:
   - If staged changes exist, analyze `git diff --staged`.
   - Otherwise, analyze `git diff`.

3) Analyze changes:
   - Identify primary intent (feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, build, ci).
   - Infer scope from paths/modules when clear.
   - Detect multiple concerns and recommend splitting if appropriate.
   - Detect breaking changes:
     - removed/renamed public APIs
     - behavior changes
     - schema changes
     - incompatible config changes

Output Format (exactly):

A) Summary
- 2–4 bullets describing what changed
- Whether staged or unstaged diffs were used
- Whether multiple commits are recommended

B) Recommended Commit(s)
- If a single commit is appropriate, show one.
- If multiple commits are cleaner, show them in order.

C) Copy-Ready Commit Message(s)
Provide the final commit message(s) in Markdown code block(s),
formatted exactly as they should be used.

Rules for Code Blocks:
- Use triple backticks
- One commit per code block
- No commentary inside the code block
- Ready to paste into `git commit -m` or an editor

Quality Bar:
- Prefer refactor over feat if behavior did not change.
- Prefer chore(deps) for dependency updates.
- Prefer build/ci for pipeline/config changes.
- Prefer docs for documentation-only changes.
- Prefer test when only tests change.
- Keep suggestions realistic and grounded in the diff.

Now run the process and produce the output.
